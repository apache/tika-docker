# tika-docker [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/apache/tika-docker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/github/apache/tika-docker)

This repo is used to create convenience Docker images for Apache Tika Server published as [apache/tika](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/tika) on DockerHub by the [Apache Tika](http://tika.apache.org) Dev team

The images create a functional Apache Tika Server instance that contains the latest Ubuntu running the appropriate version's server on Port 9998 using Java 8 (until version 1.20), Java 11 (1.21 and 1.24.1), Java 14 (until 1.27/2.0.0), Java 16 (for 2.1.0), and Java 17 LTS for newer versions.

There is a minimal version, which contains only Apache Tika and it's core dependencies, and a full version, which also includes dependencies for the GDAL and Tesseract OCR parsers. To balance showing functionality versus the size of the full image, this file currently installs the language packs for the following languages:
* English
* French
* German
* Italian
* Spanish.

To install more languages simply update the apt-get command to include the package containing the language you required, or include your own custom packs using an ADD command.

## Usage

### Default

You can pull down the version you would like using:

    docker pull apache/tika:<tag>

Then to run the container, execute the following command:

    docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:9998:9998 apache/tika:<tag>

Where <tag> is the DockerHub tag corresponding to the Apache Tika Server version - e.g. 1.23, 1.22, 1.23-full, 1.22-full.

NOTE: The latest and latest-full tags are explicitly set to the latest released version when they are published.

NOTE: In the example above, we recommend binding the server to localhost because Docker alters iptables and may expose
your tika-server to the internet.  If you are confident that your tika-server is on an isolated network
you can simply run:

    docker run -d -p 9998:9998 apache/tika:<tag>

### Custom Config

From version 1.25 and 1.25-full of the image it is now easier to override the defaults and pass parameters to the running instance.

So for example if you wish to disable the OCR parser in the full image you could write a custom configuration:

```
cat <<EOT >> tika-config.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<properties>
  <parsers>
      <parser class="org.apache.tika.parser.DefaultParser">
          <parser-exclude class="org.apache.tika.parser.ocr.TesseractOCRParser"/>
      </parser>
  </parsers>
</properties>
EOT
```
Then by mounting this custom configuration as a volume, you could pass the command line parameter to load it

    docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:9998:9998 -v `pwd`/tika-config.xml:/tika-config.xml apache/tika:2.5.0-full --config /tika-config.xml

You can see more configuration examples [here](https://tika.apache.org/2.5.0/configuring.html).

As of 2.5.0.2, if you'd like to add extra jars from your local `my-jars` directory to Tika's classpath, mount to `/tika-extras` like so:

    docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:9998:9998 -v `pwd`/my-jars:/tika-extras apache/tika:2.5.0.2-full

You may want to do this to add optional components, such as the tika-eval metadata filter, or optional
dependencies such as jai-imageio-jpeg2000 (check license compatibility first!).

### Docker Compose Examples

There are a number of sample Docker Compose files included in the repos to allow you to test some different scenarios.

These files use docker-compose 3.x series and include:

* docker-compose-tika-vision.yml - TensorFlow Inception REST API Vision examples
* docker-compose-tika-grobid.yml - Grobid REST parsing example
* docker-compose-tika-customocr.yml - Tesseract OCR example with custom configuration
* docker-compose-tika-ner.yml - Named Entity Recognition example

The Docker Compose files and configurations (sourced from _sample-configs_ directory) all have comments in them so you can try different options, or use them as a base to create your own custom configuration.

**N.B.** You will want to create a environment variable (used in some bash scripts) matching the version of tika-docker you want to work with in the docker compositions e.g. `export TAG=1.26`. Similarly you should also consult `.env` which is used in the docker-compose `.yml` files.

You can install docker-compose from [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Building

To build the image from scratch, simply invoke:

    docker build -t 'apache/tika' github.com/apache/tika-docker
   
You can then use the following command (using the name you allocated in the build command as part of -t option):

    docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:9998:9998 apache/tika
